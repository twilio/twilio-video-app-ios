# Change Log

## 0.81 (August 27, 2021)

### New Feature

- Added support for Client Track Switch Off and Video Content Preferences.
- Improved `UICollectionView` cell management so that tracks are switched off immediately when cells are offscreen.
- We recommend that you review the [ParticipantCell](https://github.com/twilio/twilio-video-app-ios/blob/v0.81/VideoApp/VideoApp/Views/Cells/Participant/ParticipantCell.swift) and [VideoView](https://github.com/twilio/twilio-video-app-ios/blob/v0.81/VideoApp/VideoApp/Views/VideoView/VideoView.swift) implementations if you use `UICollectionView` and want to update your application for Client Track Switch Off.

### Bugs

### Maintenance
