import SwiftUI

/// Setup dependencies for `RoomView`.
///
/// This seems kind of odd but it is the best solution I have come up with so far. By using a wrapper like this
/// dependencies are injected into `RoomView` as `@EnvironmentObject` which works well for UI previews. If
/// `RoomView` created the dependencies with `@StateObject` it would be more difficult to configure the
/// UI previews. If `HomeView` created the dependencies, they would not get deallocated when `RoomView`
/// goes away. Also `HomeView` shouldn't have to do complex dependency setup for other screens.
